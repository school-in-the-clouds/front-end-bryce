      <p class="items1"> School in the Cloud is a platform that trains senior volunteers to teach students in a group or individual setting. This helps kids in communities with high student to teacher ratios. It also provides retired volunteers a sense of purpose and meaning
        in their day to day life when they find themselves with more free time.</p>
